##for begin we implement all the keywords corresponding to the parks research:

(def Parc #{"KAMPA" "Bertramka" "Frantiskanska zahrada" "Obora Hvezda" "Kampa" "Kinsheho Zahrada" "Kalmovka" "Ladronka" "Letna" "Petrin" "Riegrovy sady" "Stromovka" "Vojanovy Sady" "Vysehrad" "bertramka" "frant>(def Parc2 #{"Petrin" "Riegrovy-sady" "Stromovka" "Vojanovy-Sady" "Vysehrad" "Bertramka" "Frantiskanska-zahrada" "Obora-Hvezda" "Kampa" "Kinsheho-Zahrada" "Kalmovka" "Ladronka" "Letna"})
(def wc #{"wc" "toilet" "privy" "WC" "TOILET" "PRIVY" "Wc" "Toilet" "Privy"})
(def transport #{"transportation" "transport" "tram" "tramway" "metro""bus" "autobus" "Transportation" "Transport" "Tram" "Tramway" "Metro" "Bus" "Autobus" "TRANSPORTATION" "TRANSPORT" "TRAM" "TRAMWAY" "METRO" >(def playground #{"playground" "PLAYGROUND" "Playground"})
(def sport #{"calisthenic" "Calisthenic" "sport" "Sport" "CALISTHENIC" "SPORT"})
(def skate #{"Skate" "skate" "Skating" "SKATING"})
(def bike #{"Bike" "bike" "Biking" "BIKING"})
(def attraction #{"attractions" "Attractions" "entertainment" "Entertainment"})
(def help #{"HELP" "help"})
(def location #{"location" "LOCATION" "position" "POSITION" "place" "PLACE" "locality" "LOCALITY" })
(def parking #{"parking" "car" "Parking" "Car"})
(def étinéraire #{"itinerary" "Itinerary" "Path" "path" "PATH"})


##this definition is intended to be used to terminate the program with each wrong answer or when the chatbot don't understand something:
 (defn restart[]
        (println "Program finish...   Thank's you") (shutdown-agents) ) 

##for begin our programme we implemented a "starter", it's aim to start the program with the word "hello". We puted a read-line for reading the word of the user
if the word is hello the program start but if the enter word is wrond the program don't start:

(let [yayinput (read-line)]
  (if (= yayinput "hello")
    (println "Program starting...")
   ((restart) println " ")))



(println "1st Project of Symbolic Computation, chatbot Bastien")
(println " ")

##before we lunch the program and now we need to lunch the "chatbot" so we do the same configuration of before. We puted a read-line, if the user want to start the chatbot
he need to press "Y" if he don't "N"
(println "Hello, do you whant to start the chatbot Y/N?:  ")
 (let [yayinput (read-line)]
  (if (= yayinput "Y")
    (println "Ok let's start!")
   ((restart) println "wrong")))

##another readline but for know the name of the user, we did this for the programm be "polite". When the user put this name the chatbot say directly hello <name user>
(println "What's your name ?: ")
(def x (read-line))
(println "Hello"x"!")
(println " ")


(println "###################################################################")

##the chatbot show all parks in prague by a "println" of the definition Parc2 (Parc2 reference all parks in Prague)
(println "Here are all the parks in Prague:")
(println Parc2)
(println "[PRESS ENTER]")
(def r (read-line))


(println "INFORMATIONS or HELP ? ")
(let [p (read-line)]
(if (= p "INFORMATIONS")


 {  (println "About wich Parc ?: [choose Kampa]")
  (let [z (read-line)]
  (cond
  (contains? Parc z)

{  (println "The" z "park? Ok no problem what do you want to know ?")
  (let [v (read-line)]

    (if  (contains? transport v)
       (println "The kampa park is served by several trams No. 4, 7, 9, 10, 58, 59."))

    (if  (contains? étinéraire v)
       (println "OK, the localisation for "z" is:  Malá Strana, 118 00 Prague 1"))

    (if (contains? skate v)
        (println "Yes you can skating in the Kampa parc"))

    (if (contains? wc v)
        (println "Yes Kampa have"v",you can find them at the entrance"))

    (if (contains? bike v)
        (println "Yes in Kampa park you can biking, in kind it's even better ! "))

   (if (contains? sport v)
        (println "No you can't do"v"in Kampa..."))

   (if (contains? playground v)
        (println "Yes you have a "v"in Kampa..."))

   (if (contains? attraction v)
        (println "Yes you have a beautiful view of the Vltava, Sovovy Mlýny Gallery, Čertovka, Charles Bridge, Werich House, memorial trees.."))

   (if (contains? parking v)
        (println "Yes you a big Parking at the entrance of the Kampa park !"))
)}


 :else (println "Sorry i don't understand your request..."))(restart))}
