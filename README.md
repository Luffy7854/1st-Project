This is our first project in symbolic computation : ICA1

The project is to create a chatbot in Clojure in a teamwork.
We have to follow several conditions which can help any tourists to get precious informations about their activities in this city. 

Our chatbot can give informations, answer simple questions and also simplify the life of foreign tourists effectively.

This chatbot used to be clear, easy to use and follow a ELIZA structure.


To use this simple chatbot.
   - You have to first say Hello
   - Then ask your question
   - if you have any other question you can say "Another question"
   - At the end, when you get all the informations. You can say "thank you good bye".
   
   
REQUIREMENTS : Our chatbot run only in REPL environment.
Only users who can use this environment can use the chatbot to get informations about Prague city.

If some toursits want to, they can also use another environment which allow clojure programm.


EXAMPLE of chat between any users and chatbot :

_____________________________________________

USER : "Hello, HELP"

CHATBOT : "HI, INFORMATIONS OR HELP ?"

USER : "Information"

CHATBOT : "Which city ?"

USER : "Botic" 

CHATBOT : "What is your question ?"

USER : "How can we go there ?"

CHATBOT : "TRAM 4,16 and 22" 
          "Any other questions"

USER : "NO,thanks"

CHATBOT: "Your welcome, enjoy the city :)"

___________________________________________


If users have any problems or need any informatons they can say "HELP" to get the e-mail which can help them for any request.
The e-mail is : help@praguecollege.cz

in the future, we can involve this chatbot into give further informations about a location and give more precise informations about any requests from a toursit.

We are open for contributors only if they are motivated into help involving this chatbot taking into account users criticizes.
They also have to know Prague City precisely. It will be important for the future of this chatbot.



This project was did by Abishan, Bastien and Kyllian under the direction of our Symbolic Computation teacher : Petr Svarny.
